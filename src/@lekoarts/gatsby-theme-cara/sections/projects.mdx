  I'm currently working on Teacher Regulation Agency services at DfE such as [Access your Teaching Qualifications](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/access-your-teaching-qualifications/).

  Previously I worked on the [Apply for Teacher Training](https://github.com/DFE-Digital/apply-for-teacher-training) service.

  The services are written in Ruby on Rails and use the GOV.UK Design System. They are deployed to Azure containers using Kubernetes.
